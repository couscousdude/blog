graduation was last week and ostensibly, im supposed to be happy now. 4 years of
high school are over. most of the work was boring, some of the teachers were
awful, and ill be studying in an idyllic campus by the beach come next fall. all
my friends are going off on vacation to somewhere exciting (and im at home
writing code and doing math, lol). something's off, though. i spent the last
semester of senior year wishing it would all be over and now it just
feels...kinda empty? and somehow i find myself wanting just _one more week_. one
more week to spend with and say bye to all the people i care about. hell, i'd
even put up with another week of those stupid gov assignments.

there's this idea that your perception of time speeds up as you age and senior
year is supposed to be gone in a flash. in some respects, it does feel that way.
freshman year felt faster than middle school and sophomore year felt faster than
online freshman year. senior year at school was boring but didn't necessarily
feel _long_. most of my classes certainly weren't fun but it's not like i was
_dying_ to get out. the first semester passed and we all went through that
painful college application process and then second semester started and before
you know it it was may and everyone (including me) was counting the days until
graduation.

but i also did so much more in senior year. if you asked me to describe my
sophomore year, i could probably give you a few lines. sophomore year was
terrible. i was kinda depressed, had just moved and barely knew anyone, and the
days were long and forgettable. if i did this same for this year, id probably be
able to talk for an hour just about the cool shit i was up to and all the
amazing people ive met and had to say goodbye to.

the other way to look at how time seems to speed up is that your perception of
time is defined by meaningful experiences. in general, the spaces between each
experience feels ephemeral, because you dont have many lasting memories to
define them by, kind of like filler episodes in an anime. the more meaningful
experiences you have though, the more markers you have to distinguish each block
of filler space, which makes everything feel longer. as a young child, you're
bombarded with special and formative experiences. throughout grade school, those
experiences slowly decrease (generally), until the tail end of senior year. they
spike up again through college and then usually slow down again for the rest of
your life.

at least, that's what ive heard, and ive experienced that first hand this year.
i designed and built robots, worked on cool projects, did research, and had so
many amazing experiences. the other day i was thinking about
[something i had worked on](https://github.com/Team-1280/jankboard-2) and
feeling almost nostalgic, and then i realized it was just 3 months ago. i
probably couldnt give you 2 distinctive events that happened in a 3 month period
in sophomore year and yet the past 3 months felt longer than my entire freshman
year. senior year went by quickly but my memories of it also make it feel like
one of the longest periods of my life. reminiscing about something that just
happened in december 2023 or early 2024 almost feels like im thinking about
stuff from years past. there's something so weird and "empty" about this feeling
of quasi-nostalgia but it doesn't necessarily feel bad.

## two

> <span style="font-style: normal;">夏が去っても追慕は切だ</span>

nostalgia. i've been thinking a lot about it and i guess trying to feel it at
times lately. ive gone through my old music and rewatched some old youtubers and
scrolled through old texts and dug up wayback machine archives of old web pages.
there's something so magical about that mid 2010s not-quite-modern but
not-quite-outdated web design that i spent my childhood with.

it's not like im digging up anything super old. my earliest photos date back to
2016 and my earliest concrete web presence dates back to mid-2018, only about 6
years ago. ive been looking at stuff from just 2019, 2020, and 2021, which are
still considered in recent memory by most. but it's so strange (although i
suppose not unexpected) just how different everything feels in just 2-3 years.

you know that corny saying that goes "we didn't realize we were making memories,
we just knew we were having fun"? i was convinced i wouldnt let this happen to
me. id even sometimes stop and consciously acknowledge it, when doing something
fun. but somehow, it didn't _really_ hit me until after it was over, and we all
went home from grad night, and the past 4 years all truly just _became
memories_. it's weird, though. i don't think it's particularly useful to
constantly think about the fact that you might be making lifelong memories
whenever you're doing something fun. it doesn't add anything to your experience.
at the same time, if i was really, truly aware of that fact, as i am now, i
wouldve done a few things differently, said a few things differently. but i
guess that's just the nature of regret.

## three

> You see, I actually know  
> <span style="font-style: normal;">もう君が逝ったこと</span>  
> That you’re already gone

a few people have asked me whether i'm worried about going off to a completely
new place for college and having to start over with new friends, routines,
everything. the truth is, not really? ive been to 5 elementary schools and 2
high schools and i never relied on my family for much support, so this doesnt
really feel like anything new. it's just changing schools, again, except this
time it's college and i dont bring my family. whatever. in spite of all the
emptiness i feel for having to leave behind all the relationships ive made in
the 2 years ive been here, somehow im not really worried about it. ive done this
before.

but it's different i suppose, this feels more permanent, because when i was
moving high schools, everyone else stayed the same and we could try and keep in
contact like old times but now everyone's going somewhere new and trying to do
new things with their lives and it just kind of feels like i didnt try to spend
enough time with people who i meant to spend time with and i didnt get to say
goodbye how i wanted to to everyone that i wanted to say goodbye to. this is the
first big farewell where i have regrets and feel like some important things have
been left unsaid and undone and all i can wish for is just one more week of high
school to do the things i wanted with the people who made it special. but i
guess that's just life.

## four

<br />

> <span style="font-style: normal;">そして人生最後の日、君が見えるのな

> And then if I could see you, on the last day of my life

some people say that high school is the best 4 years of your life. frankly,
that's quite sad and it gives off huge "peaked in high school" vibes. but was
senior year the best year of my life _so far_?

maybe. i dont know. i never stayed in one place long enough to really feel
completely at home and the whole "danville bubble" around here of people who
grew up and spent their whole lives here who cant comprehend life anywhere else
definitely doesnt apply to me. ive known the people here at most for 3 years and
mostly for only 1 or 2, but ive had an amazing year. i guess it'd be fair to
call it the best year so far, but i certainly wont let it be the best year of my
_life_.

here's to many more best years. onto the next.
