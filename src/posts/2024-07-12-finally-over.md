graduation was last week and ostensibly, im supposed to be happy now. 4 years of
high school are over. most of the work was boring, some of the teachers were
awful, and ill be studying in an idyllic campus by the beach come next fall. all
my friends are going off on vacation to somewhere exciting (and im at home
writing code and doing math, lol). something's off, though. i spent the last
semester of senior year wishing it would all be over and now it just feels so
... _empty_ and all i can ask for is just _one more week_. one more week to
spend with and say bye to all the people i care about. hell, i'd even put up
with another week of those stupid gov assignments.

they say that your perception of time speeds up as you age and senior year is
supposed to be gone in a flash. in some ways, it does feel that way. senior year
didn't necessarily feel _long_. most of my classes certainly weren't fun but
it's not like i was _dying_ to get out. the first semester passed and we all
went through that painful college application process and then second semester
started and as everyone started getting their decisions back the vibes all
chilled out and before you know it it was may and everyone including me were
counting the days until graduation.

but i also did so much more in senior year. if you asked me to describe my
sophomore year, i could probably give you a few lines. sophomore year was
terrible. i was almost depressed, just moved and didn't know anyone, and the
days were long and forgettable. if i did this same for this year, id probably be
able to talk for an hour just about the cool shit i was up to and all the
amazing people ive met and had to say goodbye to.

the other part of the notion that time seems to speed up as you age is that your
perception of time is defined by meaningful experiences. in general, the spaces
between each experience feels ephemeral, because you dont have many lasting
memories to define them by, kind of like filler episodes in an anime. the more
meaningful experiences you have though, the more markers you have to distinguish
each block of filler space, which makes everything feel longer. at least, that's
what ive heard, and ive experienced that first hand this year. i designed and
built robots, worked on cool projects, did research, and had so many amazing
experiences. the other day i was thinking about
[something i had worked on](https://github.com/Team-1280/jankboard-2) and
feeling almost nostalgic, and then i realized it was just 3 months ago. i
probably couldnt give you 2 distinctive events that happened in a 3 month period
in sophomore year and yet the past 3 months felt longer than my entire freshman
year. there's something so weird and "empty" about this feeling of
quasi-nostalgia but it doesn't necessarily feel bad.

_nostalgia_. i've been thinking a lot about it and i guess trying to feel it at
times lately. ive gone through my old music and rewatched some old youtubers and
scrolled through old texts and dug up wayback machine archives of old web pages.
there's something so magical about that mid 2010s not-quite-modern but
not-quite-outdated web design that i spent my childhood with.

it's not like im digging up anything super old. my earliest photos back to 2016
and my earliest concrete web presence dates back to mid-2018, which was only
about 6 years ago. ive been looking at stuff from just 2019, 2020, and 2021,
which are still considered in recent memory by most. but it's so strange
(although i suppose not unexpected) just how different everything feels in just
2-3 years.

you know that corny saying that goes "we didn't realize we were making memories,
we just knew we were having fun"? i was aware that i was making memories the
whole time. id even sometimes stop and consciously acknowledge it. but somehow,
it didn't _really_ hit me until after it was over, and we all went home from
grad night, and the 4 years all truly became just memories. it's weird, though.
i don't think it's particularly useful to constantly think about the fact that
you might be making lifelong memories whenever you're doing something fun. it
doesn't add anything to your experience. at the same time, if i was really,
truly aware of that fact, as i am now, i wouldve done a few things differently.
but i guess that's just the nature of regret.

> You see, I actually know  
> <span style="font-style: normal;">もう君が逝ったこと</span>  
> That you’re already gone

am i worried about going off to a completely new place for college and having to
start over with new friends, routines, everything? a few people have asked me
that. the truth is, not in the slightest. ive been to 5 elementary schools and 2
high schools and i never relied on my family for much support emotionally, so
this doesnt really feel like anything new. it's just changing schools, again,
except this time it's college. whatever. in spite of all the emptiness i feel
for having to leave behind all the relationships ive made in the 2 years ive
been here, im not really worried about it. ive done this before.

but it's weird, somehow this feels more permanent, because when i was moving
high schools, everyone else stayed the same and we could keep in contact like
old times but now everyone's going somewhere new and trying to do new things
with their lives and it just kind of feels like i didnt try to spend enough time
with people who i meant to spend time with and i didnt get to say goodbye how i
wanted to to everyone that i wanted to say goodbye to. this is the first big
farewell where i have regrets and feel like some important things have been left
unsaid and all i can ask for is just one more week of high school to do the
things i wanted with the people who made it special. but i guess that's just
life.
