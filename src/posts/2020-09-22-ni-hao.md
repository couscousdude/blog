Haskell is a great language. It is a pure functional programming language with
strong static typing. It is also a lazy language, which means that it does not
evaluate expressions until it is absolutely necessary. This can lead to some
interesting performance characteristics.

toSlug :: T.Text -> T.Text
toSlug =
  T.intercalate (T.singleton '-') . T.words . T.toLower . clean
```

We can also try some math. Here is a simple theorem:

Seems like it doesnt quite work yet.
